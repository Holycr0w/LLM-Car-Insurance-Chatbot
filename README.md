This project demonstrates the development of an intelligent car insurance chatbot using large language models (LLMs) integrated with the LangChain framework. Designed to assist users with policy-related queries, the chatbot offers functionalities such as policy verification, updates, claims handling, and personalized recommendations. Core technical features include prompt engineering for dialogue structuring, document integration using pdfplumber for accessing policy data, and user interaction management through LangChain's memory modules. The chatbot showcases high natural language understanding, accurate task completion, and user-centric interactions, providing a streamlined and responsive experience for car insurance management. Potential future enhancements include multi-modal support and robust security protocols
